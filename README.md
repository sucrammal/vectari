2024 Data Science Internship

This repository stores the sandboxes and coding projects I was tasked with during my internship at Vectari. Here are some of the highlights of what I accomplished: 
- Combined LLMs and traditional NLP techniques to clean CFPB bank complaint data. Benchmarked the effectiveness of various prompts and embeddings.
- Used traditional ML techniques to cluster and classify data. K-means for clustering and TSNE to visualize results, KNN and Random Forest for supervised classificaiton.
- Used BERT to make a more lightweight classifier before trying out LLMs.
- HPO for SetFit with other intern, [Harris Chen](https://github.com/Harris-Chen0)
- Created a prompt classifier: using CO-STAR and TIDD-EC frameworks, data cleaning and selection, and fine tuning to classify digital payment complaints.
